Week Six:

  Added more interactivity: 
    - Spinning cube is interactive
    - Emissive sphere & point lights change color/intensity
    - CHANGE THE SUN COLOR
    - Made "ground" color more realistic 


Week Five:

 - Added objects with animations
 - Added shadows & multiple objects casting shadows
 - Translated A and D controls to navigate XZ plane relative to perspective
 - Started working on OrbitControls (better camera rotation implementation than mine)
 - Created "sun"
 - Made planes render double-sided
 

Week Four:

 - Changed default objects to give user bearings
 - Added controls for Camera/user Y control
 - Made controls more intuitive (follow camera vector)
 - Started huge conversion to a new build system (4v/ has a webpack build)
 - Created an object with bump mapping


Week Three: 

 - Added lights & ability to change colors
 - Added interactivity: move around XZ plane with WASD keys
 - Added interactivity: drag to change camera angle
 - Re-thought the interface to be more immersive
 - Disabled triangles. They were very tedious to enter. 


Week Two: 
 - enabled rendering
 - input moves the camera
 - rendering objects in 3D space.

Week one: 
I decided to use triangles. A user can input as many 3D triangles as they wish. 

 - These triangles can be put together to represent any 3D face. 
 - WebGL can easily render triangles
 - Relatively easy to comprehend when compared to entering many vertices/edges
