REPORT:

Week one: 
I decided to use triangles. A user can input as many 3D triangles as they wish. 

 - These triangles can be put together to represent any 3D face. 
 - WebGL can easily render triangles
 - Relatively easy to comprehend when compared to entering many vertices/edges



Week Two: 
I enabled rendering. I moved the camera. I made objects in 3D space.


Week Three: 

 - Added lights & ability to change colors
 - Added interactivity: move around XZ plane with WASD keys
 - Added interactivity: drag to change camera angle
 - Re-thought the interface to be more immersive
 - Disabled triangles. They were very tedious to enter.
