title="Multimodal non-rigid image registration based on elastodynamics",
journal="The Visual Computer",
year="2018",
month="Jan",
day="01",
volume="34",
number="1",
pages="21--27",
abstract="In this paper, we present a new multimodal image registration technique established on elastodynamics notion. The main idea behind this concept is the progression of waves on an elastic body as soon as it is disturbed from its initial rest state. We propose to solve the multimodal registration problem by modeling the non-linear deformations as elastic waves and iteratively solving the elastodynamics wave equation to estimate the transformation. The inertial force in elastodynamics model is computed as the gradient of mutual information which considers the statistical relationship between the intensities of the images acquired using different imaging modalities. We tested our method on T1--T2 weighted MR brain image pairs and MR-CT brain image pairs. The proposed registration technique was compared against a variant of demons method proposed for multimodal images. The registration results were analyzed by examining the overlay images and by computing the normalized mutual information. The qualitative and quantitative analysis proved that our proposed method registers the images better than the compared method.",

day="01",
volume="29",
number="3",
pages="217--229",
abstract="We present an object-cloning algorithm using constrained mean value interpolation over images. Different from previous methods, we first define the guidance vector field as a weighted gradient of the source and destination images in the gradient domain, which produces a similar Laplace equation to that of the original Poisson method but with different boundary conditions. Then, we use mean value coordinates to solve the new Laplace equation approximately instead of solving a large linear system. The cloned result matches well with the destination image on the luma and preserves the chroma of the source object as much as possible. Our cloned results are visually pleasing without smudging and discoloration artifacts. We also extend our approach to video object cloning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our object cloning algorithm.",
